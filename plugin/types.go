/*
Package plugin defines a set of interfaces that plugins must implement to enable wash
functonality.

All resources must implement the Entry interface. To do so they should include the EntryBase
type, and initialize it via NewEntry. For example
	type myResource struct {
		plugin.EntryBase
	}
	...
	rsc := myResource{plugin.NewEntry("a resource")}
EntryBase gives the resource a name - which is how it will be displayed in the filesystem
or referenced via the API - and tools for controlling how its data is cached.

The Group interface identifies the resource as a container for other things. Implementing it
enables displaying it as a directory in the filesystem. Anything that does not implement
Group will be displayed as a file.

The Readable interface gives a file its contents when read via the filesystem.

All of the above, as well as other types - Resource, Execable, Pipe - provide
additional functionality via the HTTP API.

// Entry is the interface for things that are representable by Wash's filesystem. This includes
// plugin roots; resources like containers and volumes; placeholders (e.g. the containers directory
// in the Docker plugin); read-only files like the metadata.json files for containers and EC2
// instances; and more. It is a sealed interface, meaning you must use plugin.NewEntry when
// creating your plugin objects.
//
// Metadata returns a complete description of the entry. See the EntryBase documentation for more
// details on when to override it.

	// Tty instructs the executor to allocate a TTY (pseudo-terminal), which lets Wash communicate
	// with the running process via its Stdin. The TTY is used to send a process termination signal
	// (Ctrl+C) via Stdin when the passed-in Exec context is cancelled.
	//
	// NOTE TO PLUGIN AUTHORS: The Tty option is only relevant for executors that do not have an API
	// endpoint to stop a running command (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes). If your executor does have an
	// API endpoint to stop a running command, then ignore the Tty option. Note that the reason we
	// make Tty an option instead of having the relevant executors always attach a TTY is because
	// attaching a TTY can change the behavior of the command that's being executed.
	//
	// NOTE TO CALLERS: The Tty option is useful for executing your own stream-like commands (e.g.
	// tail -f), because it ensures that there are no orphaned processes after the request is
