There are tons of ways to get involved with Wash, whether or not you're a programmer!

- **SPREAD THE WORD.** Tell your friends, colleagues, anyone you know about Wash. Even something as simple as "Hey, check this out!" goes a long way.

- Come and hang out with us on [slack](https://puppetcommunity.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=wash)! Feel free to ask questions, answer questions from other folks, or just lurk. Come and talk to us about things about modern infra you find [complex or infuriating](https://landscape.cncf.io/), or what your [favorite hacking movie scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1ds9ceg-vy) are, or the [best monospaced font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/inconsolata).

- Got something that you'd like to connect up to Wash? We'd love to hear your ideas and help you figure out how to do it! We don't care what that 'something' is either. It can be a network device, a smart lightbulb, your bluetooth-enabled espresso scale, or just more types of resources from cloud providers. It can even be something totally wacky like Fandango.

- Got a script that uses Wash under the hood? Please let us know, and how we can help!

- Did you give a talk or presentation on Wash? Give us the link so we can help promote it!

- Are you an artist? Design some Wash-related artwork or a logo, and we'll see about putting it into the rotation for the site!

- Are you an old skool command-line gearhead with, like, *opinions* about how things should work on a command line? We'd love your help on improving the shell experience for Wash. How can our unixy Wash commands behave better? Are there new commands we should build? What colors and formatting should we use for `wash ls`? If we implemented `wash fortune`, what quotes should be in there?!

- Have some ideas on how to spice up the website? Please let us know, or feel free to put up a PR! Our website uses Jekyll; its source is in our [Github repo](https://github.com/puppetlabs/wash/tree/main/docs).

- Want to help us [build out or extend the shipped plugins](https://github.com/puppetlabs/wash/blob/main/CORE_PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md)? Feel free to put up a PR!
